          <li>
            <p>
              Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a
              sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers:
              Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March
              2021),Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995). He was
              extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families
              throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money
              to his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.

              Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
              and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme
              and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known

              ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
